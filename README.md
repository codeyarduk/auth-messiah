# Auth Messiah
#### User Authentication template for Cloudflare Workers


#### Goals
The end goal for this project is to create an easy to use wrapable auth worker that returns jwt's when used.

This enables the user to clone the repo/worker and self-host auth that is done end-end.

The ideal use would be using iframe's in your project similar to how Auth0 works.
